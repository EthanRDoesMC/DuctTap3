#### 64-bit 9.3.x with PhœnixNonce #
# 

Tihmstar basically said that doubleh3lix could be modified to work on iOS 9 if you replaced v0rtex with PhœnixNonce. There was a hint of sarcasm in the instructions, mainly because this is easier said than done, but it’s a blueprint nevertheless. 


Since KPP isn’t as big of an issue due to the nonexistance of the iPhone 7 in 2015 and early 2016, it’ll be a great learning experience without *too* much of a challenge. 


Everyone is invited to contribute, but since this is a community effort, **PLEASE** document your code. 


I get dibs on UI stuff :P

DuctTap3 is for 64-bit 9.3.x devices (including 9.3.5). It’s kinda irrelevant in the modern JB scene due to, y’know, no 64-bit devices having lost support yet, but again it’ll be a great learning experience for all involved. Practice makes perfect. 


Testers wanted! Neither PsychoTea nor I have a 64-bit 9.3.x device. Don’t sacrifice your Pangu JB either if you’re on 9.3.3 or below. Chances are that I’ll have to go buy one.
